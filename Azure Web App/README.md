### This is a small web app called ContactBook written in JavaScript by Svetlin Nakov.
#### Here I exercise and test working with terraform and azure.  

1. Add azure as a services provider
2. Configure the provider and authenticate with Terraform
3. Create a resource group
4. Add resources to the resource group:
- azurerm_service_plan - defines the compute resources and price plan for the app
- azurerm_linux_web_app - prodives the linux environment for the app
